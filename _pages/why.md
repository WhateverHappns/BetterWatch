# Why use BetterWatch?

With the continuous development of network technology and the ever-expanding scale of e-commerce, the number and variety of goods grow rapidly and users need to spend a lot of time to find the goods they want to buy. This is information overload. In order to solve this problem, recommendation system came into being.

The recommendation system is a subset of the Information Filtering System, which can be used in a range of areas such as movies, music, e-commerce, and Feed stream recommendations. The recommendation system discovers the userâ€™s personalized needs and interests by analyzing and mining user behaviors, and recommends information or products that may be of interest to the user. Unlike search engines, recommendation system do not require users to accurately describe their needs, but model their historical behavior to proactively provide information that meets user interests and needs.

In this article we use PaddlePaddle, a deep learning platform from Baidu, to build a model and combine Milvus, a vector similarity search engine, to build a personalized recommendation system that can quickly and accurately provide users with information that might be of interest to them.
