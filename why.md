# Why use BetterWatch?

The growth of the internet has resulted in an enormous amount of online data and information available to us. Tools like a recommender system allow us to filter the information which we want or need. Recommender systems can be utilized in many contexts, one of which is a playlist generator for video or music services.
In this project, I have chosen to build movie recommender systems based on K-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Matrix Factorization (MF) as well as Neural-based. The data that I have chosen to work on is the MovieLens dataset collected by GroupLens Research. This dataset has 100,000 ratings given by 943 users for 1682 movies, with each user having rated at least 20 movies. The ratings are based on a scale from 1 to 5.
The ratings make up the explicit responses from the users, which will be used for building collaborative-based filtering systems subsequently.
